# vibe-practice-loop-2025

A structured repository for organizing weekly AI coding experiments, prompts, logs, and results.

## 📋 Purpose

This repository follows a weekly practice loop methodology for GenAI-assisted coding projects. Each week's work is organized into a dedicated folder with standardized subfolders for systematic experimentation and learning.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
vibe-practice-loop-2025/
├── README.md (this file)
└── Week-[N]/
    ├── code/           # All code files and scripts
    ├── prompts/        # AI prompts and templates
    ├── experiment-logs/ # Session notes and observations
    └── results/        # Final outputs and generated content
```

## 🔄 Weekly Workflow

For each weekly practice session:

1. **Create a new Week-N folder** (e.g., Week-1, Week-2, etc.)
2. **Code folder**: Write and store your scripts, experiments, and helper utilities
3. **Prompts folder**: Save all AI prompts used during the week
4. **Experiment logs**: Document your process, what worked, what didn't, and key insights
5. **Results folder**: Collect final outputs, generated content, and successful experiments

## 🗂️ Folder Descriptions

### 📝 Code
Contains all executable code, scripts, and configuration files for your weekly experiments. Organize by experiment name or type.

### 💬 Prompts
Stores all AI prompts and prompt templates used with LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.). Document what model was used and the effectiveness of each prompt.

### 📊 Experiment Logs
Detailed session notes including:
- What you tried
- Challenges encountered
- Solutions found
- Key learnings
- Next steps

### ✨ Results
Final outputs including:
- Generated code
- AI-created content
- Visualizations
- Screenshots
- Performance metrics

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each folder contains a README.md template explaining its purpose and suggested file organization. Start with Week-1 and iterate from there!

## 📌 Best Practices

- **Date everything**: Use dates in filenames (YYYY-MM-DD format recommended)
- **Link related files**: Reference prompts in code comments, link code in experiment logs
- **Document as you go**: Don't wait until the end to write notes
- **Version your prompts**: Save iterations to track what works best
- **Capture failures too**: Failed experiments provide valuable learning insights

## 🎯 Current Status

- **Week-1**: Set up and ready for experimentation

## 📚 Resources

This repository structure supports the GenAI.Works Academy learning methodology focused on:
- Systematic experimentation with AI coding tools
- Building reusable prompt libraries
- Documenting learning journeys
- Creating a portfolio of AI-assisted projects

**Happy coding and experimenting! 🎉**
