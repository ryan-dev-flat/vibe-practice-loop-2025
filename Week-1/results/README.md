# Results Folder

## Purpose
This folder contains the final outputs and results from your Week 1 experiments and AI-assisted coding projects.

## Contents
- Generated code outputs
- AI-generated content (text, images, data)
- Final project files
- Processed results and data
- Visualization outputs
- Demo files
- Screenshots of successful runs
- Performance metrics or benchmarks

## Organization
- Save both successful and interesting failed results
- Include metadata (what created it, when, how)
- Link back to the prompts and code that generated the result
- Note any post-processing or modifications

## Documentation
For each significant result, consider documenting:
- What was generated
- Which AI tool/model was used
- The prompt or code that created it
- Any unexpected aspects
- How it might be improved
- Potential use cases
